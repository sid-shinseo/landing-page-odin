# Landing Page - The Odin Project

Welcome to my **Landing Page** project built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## 📝 Overview

This project is a static landing page designed to practice basic HTML and CSS skills learned in the early stages of The Odin Project. The goal is to replicate a simple design layout while focusing on:

- Semantic HTML structure
- Layout using Flexbox
- Styling with CSS (colors, fonts, spacing, etc.)
- Reusable components like buttons and sections

## 🚀 Goals

- Build a static landing page based on a provided design
- Use only HTML and CSS (no frameworks or JavaScript)
- Practice clean, responsive layout techniques

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Flexbox
